## CollectingSanderson.com

[CollectingSanderson.com](https://collectingsanderson.com) is an in-depth database of most known editions of Brandon Sanderson's books. Stretching all the way back to before his first published works, it includes information on pre-release, foreign, and even illegal editions.

## Brandon Blue Book

The Brandon Blue Book is a continuously-updated compendium of last-known sales data for Brandon's books on the open market. When looking to buy or sell, it is a valuable resource for gauging what the market currently believes a reasonable price for the item should be.

## Dragonsteel Nexus Booth

The Sanderson Collectors Guild has been a consistent exhibitor at every single convention run by Brandon and Dragonsteel, Inc. Our booth serves as a nexus for casual and avid collectors, often selling rare editions or freely giving away collecting information and advice to all convention goers. Look for us at this year's convention!

## SCG Discord

The Sanderson Collectors Guild discord hosts thousands of collectors from around the world. There are educational resources, in-depth discussions, and even marketplaces for buying, selling, or auctioning off Sanderson collectibles. It's never too late to start collecting!

## SCG Facebook Group

Like with the Discord server, the Sanderson Collectors Guild Facebook group provides a space for collectors to interact and transact with each other.

## SCG Merch Store

All these resources aren't cheap! Help support us by purchasing branded swag. All proceeds are rolled back in to the organization to fund future projects.
